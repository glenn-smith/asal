        <h3>Our Mission</h3><span style=
        "font-size:6px;"><br /></span><span style=
        "font-size:13px;">The Afghan Stray Animal League is a
        private non-profit organization in the U.S. that operates
        and supports a shelter and low-cost veterinary clinic for
        homeless, abandoned, sick or injured small animals in
        Afghanistan. The shelter is located in a refurbished house
        in Kabul, the Afghan capital, which has a large population
        of neglected street dogs and cats as well as thousands of
        backyard animals such as goats and donkeys whose owners
        cannot afford treatment for them.</span><span style=
        "font-size:6px;"><br />
        &nbsp;
        <br /></span><span style="font-size:13px;">The shelter has
        been open full-time since the fall of 2004. It can
        comfortably house about 20 dogs and about 30 cats, and we
        have helped more than 400 animals so far. The shelter has a
        full-time Afghan staff including a veterinarian, an
        assistant veterinarian and manager. It has a fully stocked
        pharmacy and a small surgical clinic. The shelter staff
        accepts any animal that is brought to the door for help,
        including treatment of injuries, vaccinations, deworming,
        bathing and treatment of skin diseases. We have a car and
        driver to pick up any small animal that is injured, sick or
        found by someone who cannot bring it to the
        shelter.</span><span style="font-size:6px;"><br />
        &nbsp;
        <br /></span><span style="font-size:13px;">One of our major
        goals is to reduce the population of unwanted street
        animals. We offer both neutering and spaying of cats and
        dogs, in consultation with international veterinarians who
        visit the shelter or work with the national university
        veterinary school. No fees are charged for any services,
        although any foreign pet owners who come for vet care are
        asked for donations to cover the cost of vaccines and
        medicines. Our policy on euthanasia is that this should be
        used only as a last resort in the case of severe trauma or
        untreatable illness.</span><span style=
        "font-size:6px;"><br /></span><span style=
        "font-size:6px;">&nbsp;
        <br /></span><span style="font-size:13px;">Our primary
        mission is to care for needy small animals, restore them to
        health and find them loving homes. Most of those who adopt
        our animals are foreigners, and we are able to arrange to
        ship their rescued pets home if needed. We are also working
        to foster and encourage a culture of companion animal
        ownership in Afghanistan. The country has been devastated
        by war and poverty, and there is widespread neglect, abuse
        and fear of animals. We provide free dog houses, food,
        vaccines and other supplies to any Afghan who adopts a pet,
        and we conduct home visits to ensure the animal is being
        well treated. We also offer free talks at&nbsp; local
        non-profit childrenâ€™s programs about the humane treatment
        of animals.</span>
