We finally caught him, put him in a crate and took him to the shelter. It turned out that his leg had been broken a long time ago and then healed. It is permanently damaged and unusable but totally healed, and he is now in very good health. At first he hid in a corner and growled at everyone, but within a few weeks he had relaxed and become very happy with the staff and the other dogs. He has been living with us now for about nine months. He would make an excellent companion for someone who is at home a lot and wants a dog that does not need a lot of exercise. Sausage is basically a couch potato, but it is amazing how agile he is on three legs. He is healthy, vaccinated, friendly and sociable.
