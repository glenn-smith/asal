a:2:{s:7:"VERSION";i:1;s:7:"CONTENT";s:1418:"We started out helping stray animals in Kabul in early 2002, when there were virtually no veterinary services and no shelters at all in the country, after nearly three decades of war and destruction. One of the first was Mr. Stumpy, a filthy, scared and irascible alley cat whose hind leg was crushed when he was hit by a car. We were able to persuade am Afghan vet who worked with imported land-mine sniffer dogs to amputate his leg, but a few days later he escaped from a car into the streets. When we finally found him again, his surgical wound was black and infected. It took more than a month of excruciating daily bandage changes, but Mr. Stumpy survived and recovered. A US army reserve vet, Trudy Salerno, vaccinated him for rabies and distemper. Over time he stopped clawing everyone and became a happy, sociable cat. 
  
Through friends of friends, we found someone willing to adopt him in the states, and in the summer of 2004, Mr. Stumpy went to live with Bryan Wockley in Vermont, where he learned to climb tall trees on three legs and his signature, insistent miaow became known to all. Mr. Stumpy now lives with Bryan and his family in the Washington, DC, area, and he was a special guest at our annual summer barbecue in Arlington to raise funds for the Kabul shelter. The photos here show Mr. Stumpy in Kabul just after his amputation, and three years later with Bryan and his family in the States. ";}
