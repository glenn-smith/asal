She is about a year old now, extremely affectionate, healthy and spayed. But she is also very busy, energetic and full of beans. She needs a large outdoor space to run in every day, preferably with another energetic dog who can help wear her out. We are trying to find her a new home that can accommodate this indefatigable bundle of love and life. Please contact kabulcritters@gmail.com if you can help.";}
