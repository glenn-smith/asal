a:2:{s:7:"VERSION";i:1;s:7:"CONTENT";s:730:"Se Pai, which means Three Legs, is a small gray cat who came to us from the streets with a wounded back leg. It is now totally healed and she hops around on three legs like a pro. Smoke is one of two kittens who were rescued by a friend in Herat and sent to us in Kabul in a home-made wooden box. The friend was not able to catch their Mom at first but eventually he did, and she was also sent to Kabul to be reunited with her two kittens. Sadly the other kitten died of an infection shortly after the reunion, but Smoke continues to thrive. His favorite activity is climbing up the wire mesh to the very top of his play cage, which is about seven feet high. We hope to send Smoke and his Mom home eventually with their rescuer.  ";}
