a:2:{s:7:"VERSION";i:1;s:7:"CONTENT";s:613:"This puppy and kitten were both found on the Kabul streets the same week last November. The kitten was shivering and had pneumonia. The puppy had a bad intestinal infection and was very sick. They spent about two weeks together in the sun room, both getting intensive treatment. They spent much of their time together inside this furry hideaway that was donated to the shelter. Sadly, the kitten never recovered from her illness and died. The puppy got well and is now running around the compound in a mini-pack with the other small dogs, learning to pose soulfully whenever potential adopters come by to browse. ";}
