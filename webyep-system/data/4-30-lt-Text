a:2:{s:7:"VERSION";i:1;s:7:"CONTENT";s:770:"This frisky little girl is MY DONNA, a friendly and playful hound we found wandering and emaciated near the Kabul airport last spring. The word for airport in the local language is maidan, pronounced My Don, so we named her Maidan and I converted that to My Donna. She is now happy, spayed and rather stout after about nine months at the shelter. Her favorite activity is to play with a tennis ball. If you throw it, she will fetch it, bring it back and drop it at your feet and look at you expectantly, just as if she had been doing it all her life. My Donna needs a home with an active family, hopefully including someone tireless enough to play ball with her all day. If you would like to adopt her or help find her a home, please email us at kabulcritters@gmail.com.";}
