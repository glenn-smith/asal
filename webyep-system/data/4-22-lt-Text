a:2:{s:7:"VERSION";i:1;s:7:"CONTENT";s:992:"This is Blackie, a sweet little female hound who was brought to our shelter from the streets in May. Her ears had been cut off and her hind leg was badly mangled and infected from being hit by a car. We thought she would not survive, but a good friend of ours who is a surgeon volunteered to operate on her leg. He successfuly amputated it with the entire staff watching, all the infection was removed, and Blackie recovered quickly. The leg healed very well, and within several weeks she was running and hopping around like a puppy. 

After an appeal went out, a number of friends helped raise the money to bring Blackie to the USA, especially Cora and Brian and Maria. She made the journey in September and is currently being fostered by Mike and Melinda in Washington, D.C., while her adoptive family gets ready to move to move to a house with a big back yard. Blackie, now renamed Gracie, is so full of joy and energy that she needs lots of space to romp around and express herself.
