a:2:{s:7:"VERSION";i:1;s:7:"CONTENT";s:1515:"YELLOW TOM, a brave and battered male alley cat, was found by a Danish aid worker and brought to the shelter in the summer of 2006, nearly dead from fight wounds, starvation and respiratory disease. With months of veterinary care and a lot of TLC, he gradually regained his strength, his wounds healed and he began to put on weight. At first he had no idea how to show affection, so when we opened his cage to feed and care for him, he would clamp down lightly on our hands with his teeth and not let go. It was his way of saying thanks.
 
Yellow Tom finally became healthy enough to leave the shelter. He was neutered by Dr. Rahmatullah and then adopted by several Americans living in Kabul. They took great care of him for more than six months, but in June he began to go downhill again. In early July the staff took him to an American vet who was working as a consultant with the national veterinary school. He said Tom was suffering from many serious chronic ailments, including liver disease, and was near the end of his life. The American vet, Dr. Hodgson, and Dr. Rahmatullah did their best to save Tom, but he did not make it. Tom died peacefully today at the home of his adopters in Kabul and was buried in a flower bed in their yard. We will all miss him terribly, but we are also grateful that he came to us, that he found a loving home, and that he was able to spend his final months in peace, comfort and safety after a very hard life as a homeless fighting tom on the streets of Kabul. July 7, 2007.";}
