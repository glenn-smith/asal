a:2:{s:7:"VERSION";i:1;s:7:"CONTENT";s:1063:"RED ALERT - Digger's flying in to New York in a few days and is in desperate need of a foster home until we can find a permanent home for her. If you are interested in providing fostering care email us at kabulcritters@gmail.com

Digger, the brown and white hound with the sweet eyes behind the wire fence, is a bouncy and affectionate girl we found curled up in an alley all by herself. She was about three months old at the time, covered with fleas and very skinny. Now she is about nine months old, very well fed and very healthy. She is full of beans and loves to play catch and roll in the grass. She would be happiest spending every single moment with people. She is a perfect dog park dog, and perfect for families with kids who can run and play with her. She currently shares an outdoor pen with three other dogs about her own size. They constantly wrestle and tussle in the mud but get along very well. She would do very well in a home with other dogs. If you would like to know more about adopting this dog, please email us at kabulcritters@gmail.com.";}
