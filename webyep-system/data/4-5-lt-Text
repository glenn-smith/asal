a:2:{s:7:"VERSION";i:1;s:7:"CONTENT";s:1144:"A group of American soldiers on patrol in the summer of 2006 found a group of Afghan boys tormenting a black and white puppy, which unfortunately is a common sight. They were trying to hack off its ears with a knife, which is often done to Afghan dogs in the belief that it will make them more aggressive in fights. The soldiers rescued Charlie from the boys and took him to their base in Kabul, where a military veterinarian named Captain Jones called us to come get him. 
  
One of Charlieâ€™s ears was hanging by a thread, but Dr. Rahmatullah was able to reattach the ear with sutures, and miraculously it healed and did not become infected. This was one of the most successful rescues and recoveries we had that year, and it showed us what was possible to accomplish even though we still do not have sophisticated medical equipment or diagnostic tools. Charlie became a healthy and happy puppy, and he was adopted by another American soldier. The photo at left shows Charlie as he came to the shelter, with one ear badly wounded. The photo on the home page shows Charlie just two weeks later when his ear was on the way to full recovery. ";}
