a:2:{s:7:"VERSION";i:1;s:7:"CONTENT";s:842:"This is a genuine Afghan hound, or tazi, a fragile and intelligent dog whose breed was once raised as royal hunting dogs in Afghanistan. A British friend found him recently in a street in Kabul, badly injured, with abscesses and gangrene and sores. He was horribly thin and filthy, with badly matted hair. We feared he would die. It is very unusual to find tazis in the country now, and especially one that has been lost or abandoned. We were very lucky that our friend was able to bring him to the shelter in a car, and that another friend, a veterinarian from Europe who was visiting the country, was able to come and treat his wounds, which were very complicated. Our Tazi is now beginning to recover, eating like a horse and looking better each day with brushing and washing. He will eventually be adopted by some friends in Afghanistan. ";}
