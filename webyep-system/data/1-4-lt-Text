a:2:{s:7:"VERSION";i:1;s:7:"CONTENT";s:1313:"One of the most special dogs we helped after Tigger House opened in 2004 was Nelson, a badly disabled and weakened black and white spaniel-style dog who could barely walk because of infant vitamin deficiency and was also blind in one eye. Nelson was found on the streets of Kabul and spent nearly a year at the shelter, where we gave him lots of vitamins and care, but we despaired of finding him a home. Everyone who visited us loved Nelson’s sweet and intrepid personality, and some friends led by Julia deBold, an American physician’s assistant stationed in Kabul, gradually raised enough funds to send him to the States. 
  
Fortunately, we found a wonderful woman in southwest Oregon named Michelle Parris who kept abused and abandoned dogs and other animals on her small farm, called Grateful Dogs Rescue. In the spring of 2006 we sent Nelson to Oregon, where he became part of Michelle’s amazing rescued pack that included dachsunds and Saint Bernards, two llamas, a pony and a donkey, goats and a pig. Nelson grew stronger and more confident in his surroundings, and he is now able to keep up with the others on daily walks through the wooded hills of Michelle’s sanctuary. The photos here show Nelson at the shelter in Kabul and later in Oregon with Michelle and the other members of her pack. ";}
