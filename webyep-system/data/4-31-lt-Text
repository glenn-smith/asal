a:2:{s:7:"VERSION";i:1;s:7:"CONTENT";s:947:"Beanie is a small and compact molasses colored hound. She is not beautiful or graceful or dignified, but she is full of beans and lots of fun. We found her in the street in Pakistan after she had been used for student surgical training and then put back out to fend for herself. She had just been spayed and was sleeping on a burlap sack in a market. We fed her there for a few nights, and finally decided to take her in. She slept like a log for 24 hours, then blossomed into a playful and mischievous sprite who wants to dance and race and run rings around all the time. She is very healthy and spayed, and she would make a wonderful pet for a family with kids and a yard and lots of energy. She could even learn to play frisbe. We desperately need to find her a home soon, or at least a foster, and must bring her to the states in late february. Please let us know if you have an interest in Beanie by emailing us at kabulcritters at gmail.com ";}
