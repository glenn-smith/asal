a:2:{s:7:"VERSION";i:1;s:7:"CONTENT";s:1415:"Shep is a blind German shepherd puppy who was brought to Tigger House in the winter of 2008. He was very thin and unhappy. He kept wandering forlornly around the outdoor pen, bumping in to other, faster dogs who always beat him to the dinner bowl. Skitters is a tiny dog who was really terrified of people when she reached the shelter and also could not compete with the larger dogs in the outside pen. In February we brought them both inside the shelter, where they decided to make a suitcase into their bed. Skitters gradually overcame her fear of humans after some intense TLC, and Shep grew more confident of his surroundings. 

During the summer we launched a campaign to find them homes and raise the money to bring them to the USA. Through the hard work and generosity of our good friends Cora and Brian Hellings, as well as others, we were able to raise the money. Cora also told us about a wonderful place called Rolling Dog Ranch in Montana for blind animals. We got in touch with the owners and they decided to adopt Shep and help pay for his trip. In June I brought both Shep and Skitters back to the States. Shep went to live in Montana, and you can learn all about his new life by logging on to www.rollingdogranch.com. Skitters went to live with Cora and Brian in Washington State, where she is now part of a happy family. Thank you so much to everyone who made their journey and new life possible.";}
