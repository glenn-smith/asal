a:2:{s:7:"VERSION";i:1;s:7:"CONTENT";s:573:"Naranji, which means orange-colored, is a sweet marmalade cat who was rescued by a friend and brought to the shelter this winter. The friend hoped to take her to Europe but was not able to do so. Now Naranji is living with two other cats in a large play-cage at the Kabul shelter. She is safe and warm and healthy, but she would much rather be playing ping-pong or sitting on someone's lap in front of a fire. Every time we enter the cage to feed or clean the cats, she immediately tries to climb up our legs and into our arms. A clearer message she could not be sending.  ";}
