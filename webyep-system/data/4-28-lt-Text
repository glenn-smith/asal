a:2:{s:7:"VERSION";i:1;s:7:"CONTENT";s:920:"Honey, the small yellow hound, was found on the street as a small frightened puppy with a broken hind leg, probably from being hit by a car. Someone brought her to us, and we were able to operate and repair the leg with assistance from an international vet. She has now totally recovered and romps around the yard, holding her own with larger and stronger dogs. She is a ball of energy but she also clings to people, always running up to greet us with kisses and becoming sad when we leave. She is now about nine months old, still small and slim, and she will not get much bigger. she would make a great addition to a home with a small yard or limited space. she has lived with dogs of all kinds and loves everyone she meets. On Nov 21st Honey flew to Boston and is currently being offered up for adoption in that area. If you would like to know more about adopting this dog, please email us at kabulcritters@gmail.com. ";}
