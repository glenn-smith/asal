a:2:{s:7:"VERSION";i:1;s:7:"CONTENT";s:925:"Wattie, the little brindle colored pup lying on the blanket, survived a terrible ordeal in which some boys tried to cut off his ears, something that is unfortunately a customary practice in afghanistan. When we found him in a village, one of the ears was half missing and badly infected. We were able to pick him up and take him to the shelter. With treatment, his ear recovered and healed nicely, and he grew into a stout and busy pup who is healthy in every other way. He is about seven months old now. When he looks at you, he has a whimsical expression because one of his ears is longer than the other. Whoever adopts wattie will have a loyal and active friend for life, and will never mistake him for another dog. he gets along well with all people, and has happily shared his pen with many dogs of all sizes and breeds. If you would like to know more about adopting this dog, please email us at kabulcritters@gmail.com.";}
