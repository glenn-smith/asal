Despite her infirmities, she had a winsome personality and a melodic, chirpy miaow to welcome all regular visitors. A woman who worked for the UN fell in love with her, gave her the incongruous name of Genghis, and took her home as a companion. Eventually Jacky was transferred to Italy and then to Ghana. She left Genghis in our care but never forgot her. In fact, her strong determination to be reunited with Genghis created a huge electronic paper trail, with many dozens of emails bouncing around the globe as various people, eventually known as The Genghis Team, plotted complicated ways to arrange it all. Finally, in mid-August of this year, Genghis flew to Pakistan, Dubai and then on to Accra, where Jacky was waiting anxiously. We managed to reach her on a cell phone in Accra while she was at the airport, and she called back just as Genghis was coming out of customs. There it was on the phone -- that melodic, chirpy miaow of welcome, although this time with a bit more peremptory tone. Congratulations on the happy mission accomplished to Genghis, Jacky and the Global Genghis Team.  ";}
