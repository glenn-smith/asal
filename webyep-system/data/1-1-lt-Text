The friend fished him out of the ditch and brought him to us, covered with slime and shivering with cold. After several baths, blow-dries and lots of powdered puppy formula, he looked like a brand new puppy. We named him after a famous clear blue lake in north central Afghanistan. He was adopted several months later.";}
